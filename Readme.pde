Brief description of project:
Yarn Wars is a game where Angry Yarn Balls fall from the sky and you must shoot them with a Cannon in order to neutralise them before they reach the 
bottom of the screen/the ground. If you shoot one successfully you increase your score by 1. If an Angry Yarn Ball reaches the bottom of the screen, you lose a 
life. If your score reaches 10 the speed of the Angry Yarn Balls increases. There are sheep clouds floating across the screen, they display the current game, 
the score and how many lives have been used up. The default setup has 3 battles with 5 lives per battle. The right and left arrows 
on your keyboard control movement of the cannon across the x-axis. The control (ctrl) key controls the bullets. Pressing it once will shoot 1 bullet.
When you run the program a dialog box will appear asking the player to choose a difficulty level (this determines the number of Angry Yarn Balls in an 
array).Once this step is complete another dialog box will appear with instructions for the game, it also asks the player to enter their name and click 
OK to start the game.
After each Battle a dialog box will show the player their score, they will be prompted to click OK to continue to the next Battle. After all Battles
are complete a dialog box with scores will appear. The game is over.
